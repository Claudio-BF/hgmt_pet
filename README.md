# hgmt_pet
Uses TOPAS to simulate a PET scanner. Specifically built to simulate experimental PET scanners that have extremely good timing accuracy, but no energy accuracy. For instance, this uses covariance matrices instead of traditional lors based on the assumption that the timing accuracy is on the order of the spatial accuracy.
